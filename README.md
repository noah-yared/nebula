# NEBULA
Nebula (Network-Enhanced Bundles for Unified Load-Aware Storage) is a system design for enhanced extraterrestrial communication as part of the (slightly fictional) SolarNet project, which is based off NASA's LunaNet.
I worked on this system design as part of a team. The specification is outlined in `spec.pdf` and the final design report is in `design.pdf`.
